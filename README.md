## What is CallAsap?

Each year, more than 500 million people visit Europe. Characterized by stunning scenery in most of its countries, Europe is also the mother of literature, music, art and philosophy: a seemingly perfect destination for permanent residence â€“ even more so when its organized workplaces are taken into account.

Safety first, as they say; a phrase more than applicable in Europe. Each country has its own unique emergency numbers, while at the same time there is a single 3-digit phone number (112) available everywhere in Europe. All calls are given immediate response and answered in a variety of languages, depending on the country.

Here in CallAsap, we have gathered Europe's emergency phone numbers with reliability and precision. All information can be intuitively and quickly accessed via the "Search" option.

We have also designed our own API from scratch, which is publicly available [here](http://83.212.115.201/api/) and [here](https://github.com/gkamtzir/callAsap-API-PHP) and can be freely used.
