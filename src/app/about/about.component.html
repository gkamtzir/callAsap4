  <h1>ABOUT</h1>

  <br />
  <p i18n>
    Each year, more than 500 million people visit Europe.
    Characterized by stunning scenery in most of its countries,
    Europe is also the mother of literature, music, art and philosophy: a seemingly perfect destination for permanent residence â€“ even more so when its organized workplaces are taken into account.

    <i>Safety first</i>, as they say; a phrase more than applicable in Europe.
    Each country has its own unique emergency numbers, while at the same time there is a single 3-digit phone number (112) available <i>everywhere</i> in Europe.
    All calls are given immediate response and answered in a variety of languages, depending on the country.
